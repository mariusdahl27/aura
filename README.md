AVRA is an experimental 128-bit computer architecture.

The architecture is described in three parts:

* Part I: Architectural Concepts
* Part II: Instruction Descriptions
* Part III: Instruction Encoding Tables

An additional document, instruction-encoding-charts.txt, contains an alternative presentation of the instruction encoding.
