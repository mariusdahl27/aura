AVRA is an experimental 128-bit computer architecture.

The architecture is described in three parts:

* Part I: Introduction and preliminaries
* Part II: Instruction descriptions
* Part III: Instruction encoding

An additional document, instruction-encoding-charts.txt, contains an alternative presentation of the instruction encoding.
